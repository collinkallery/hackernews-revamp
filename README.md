# Hacker News - UI & UX Revamp

## Abstract

During the third quarter of our time at Turing School of Software & Design, we were given a very loosely-structured project called "Stretch", where we needed to implement our recently-learned skills in React and the React Testing Library, but also teach ourselves and implement a new technology that has not yet been taught to us. We were given the "Miscellaneous" category, where we were given the opportunity to delve into styled components and more advanced accessibility tools. We were also told to find an API and create a project around it, so we chose the Hacker News API. Hacker News is a widely used news outlet for stories related to technology. It is used by developers, project managers, hackers, and anyone who may be interested in brushing up on current events in the world of tech. The desktop application, however, seems to create conflict between developers, with many claiming its simplistic UI makes it easy to navigate with minimal distractions, while others claim it's a UI eyesore, with little organization and no visually-pleasing elements. For our stretch project, we decided to revamp the UI and UX of Hacker News using React, with a strong focus on styled components and refined accessibility. 

## Specific Objectives

1. The application cannot simply be a display of data - there needs to be some way for the user to work with or manipulate the data. 
2. The application should be a multi-page application using React Router. 
3. The use of at least one external API.
4. Use of Styled Components. 
5. 100% passing accessibility testing using an accessibility analyzer like A11y or Axe. 
6. Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
7. Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
8. Write tests for React components and some asynchronous functionality.
